Installation

    git clone https://github.com/wpug/dotvim.git ~/.vim
    git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle

Create symbolic link:

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

Open Vim and issue the command:

    :BundleInstall

it will install all the "bundles" listed in the ~/.vimrc file.

Exit with the command

    :qa

Next time you open VIM it should work as expected.
