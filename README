Installation

    git clone https://github.com/wpug/dotvim.git ~/.vim

Create symbolic link:

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc

While inside your ~/.vim directory issue the following commands:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

This will initialize the Vundle submodule required for proper VIM
installation and functioning.

Open Vim and issue the command:

    :BundleInstall

it will install all the "bundles" listed in the ~/.vimrc file.

Exit with the command

    :qa

Next time you open VIM it should work as expected.
